                <p class="feelingTextPro"> An earworm for sure. This song *absolutely* belongs at the end of an 
                    indie movie, the protagonist is at the end of a long/hard journey and has to move on to a new 
                    chapter. Their car broke down in the desert the night before and are all alone. They wake up 
                    to the sun beaming in through their windshield. They get out of the car with a haggard look, 
                    stare at the horizon, and begin to walk. The camera cuts sharply to them in the desert rather 
                    than walking on the road, cuts again to them further in, then again to them climbing up a hill. 
                    Finally were at the top of the hill and their hair is gently blowing, the shots are close-ups of 
                    their face or possibly a wide angle of them at the top for a moment. We the audience, get a 
                    sense of reflection from their past and the new life they are about to embark on. Probably an 
                    abrupt black screen at the last chorus. 3-second pause, then credits. yada yada, something like 
                    that.

            <h4>Which Side are You On?</h4><br>
            <p class="feelingText">People have been striking downtown for the custodial staff at RISD. 
                Their union has been asking for a proper wage increase that's comparable to other schools 
                in the area. They are on week two and the crowd has gotten bigger every day but it's hard 
                not to see the passers-by who hardly glance at their efforts, including myself. I look at 
                the group, with their drums and whistles, absolutely agreeing that everyone deserves a living 
                wage but I keep walking by. It feels like the saying "not in my back yard". I see you protesting,
                 I agree with you, and I want you to win, but I don't do anything to help. I justify, 
                 "It's not my fight" while fully knowing that this could happen to anyone. Anyone could be in 
                 those shoes and hope that their community will join their efforts for a fair pay increase. 
                 There's a disconnect and lack of empathy for situations strangers could be going through. 
                 Which reminds me, go donate blood. Everywhere is in short supply, it's a large contribution with 
                 fairly little effort you can do for your community.</p>

                my partner and I both squealed as we found out we both loved them. He brought the speakers 
                and record player up to our room. We through this album on and jumped up and down dancing to "Feverer".
                Not many bands I'd take off work to see, but Saintseneca if you play, I'll be there.</p>

                she has tallent, oviously she's going places. But the way she cuts through this 
                specific tune is like instant butter melting, dripping over the counter, 
                and creating puddles on the floor. No matter how many times I listen to this, 
                I become that butter everytime. </p>
