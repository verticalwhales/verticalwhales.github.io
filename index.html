        Some of which are music. This is what I've been playing on repeat recently<br>
        and the best describers for what “good” is IMO.</p>

            <h2>Nora Brown</h2>
            <h4>East Virginia</h4>
            <p class="feelingTextPro">You can find a few dozen versions of the tune East Virginia, 
                but the way Nora does it is like no other. I originally found Nora on the Radiolab 
                series about Dolly Parton, to say I fell in love is an understatment. Oviously 
                she has tallent, oviously she's going places. But the way she cuts through this 
                specific tune is like instant butter melting, dripping over the counter, 
                and creating puddles on the floor. No matter how many times I listen to this, 
                I become that butter everytime. </p>

            <p class="feelingText">This is not your average walk in the desert. 
                This is a combination of 80's vampire lounge and electric cars that 
                clean the air as they drive. The album seems to melt effortlessly from 
                song to song, it's easy to close your eyes and just let the body feel 
                the waves of motion roll over it. It's a reflection all on its own.  </p>

            <p class="feelingText">Listen to the crickets, the geese, the harp, the synth, 
                the bass. The ride these 5 songs take you on is a journey of falling down 
                a hole and the climb back up. I find myself listening to the whole thing 
                on loop, feeling myself fall down and get back up, noticing the resilience 
                grow each time.</p>

                <p class="feelingText">A those grand examples of how a cover can 
                    outshine the original. Once you make art and release it 
                    to the public it's no longer yours. It's allowed to evolve
                    and move freely without you.</p>
