    <p>Born in a blizzard, Andy grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia<br> 
    and has been in love with color before they knew what color was.<br> 
    So much so, that their childhood bedroom was neon green with aqua blue trim.<br></p>

    <p>They attended Maine College of Art and received a BFA in Metalsmithing & Jewelry.<br>
    During the summers of their college years, they would work on Broadturn Farm,<br>
    digging up carrots and making bouquets for weddings.<br></p>
    
    <p>From there they have been traveling around the US working on different farms<br> 
    enjoying the good food and learning new lessons on how not to drive a tractor.<br> 
    The hunt to gain skills and new trades is never complete.<br> 
    Currently, they are in tech support at the Brown University's ICERM.<br></p>
    
    <p>In their spare time, they bind books, garden, continue learning how to code,<br> 
    and snuggle their pup Eniac. Some day they hope to have an orchard with every<br>
    kind of fruit tree that will grow in that region.</p>
