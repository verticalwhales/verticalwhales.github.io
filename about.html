    <p><b>Born in a blizzard,</b> Andy grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia
    and has been in love with color before they knew what color was.
    So much so, that their childhood bedroom was neon green with aqua blue trim.<br><br></p>

    <p>They attended Maine College of Art and received 
    a BFA in Metalsmithing & Jewelry. During the summers of their college years, 
    they would work on Broadturn Farm, digging up carrots and making bouquets for weddings.<br><br></p>
    
    <p>From there they have been traveling around the US working on different farms 
    enjoying the good food and learning new lessons on how not to drive a tractor.
    The hunt to gain skills and new trades is never complete. 
    Currently, they are in tech support at the Brown University's ICERM.<br><br></p>
    
    <p>In their spare time, they bind books, garden, continue learning how to code, 
    and snuggle their pup Eniac. Some day they hope to have an orchard with every
    kind of fruit tree that will grow in that region.</p>
